# React_draggable_carousel
this is a simple draggable carousel that i built it for fun, and it works as well as hell
since react-slick pkg from npm does not supports reponsiveness in defferent device width (b/c you need to have fixed items width for each and by that in smaller devices items with fixed sizes fall on top of each other), i built this just for that purpose.
im my carousel the **width of parent element that wraps around items is matters** and you can change it in different screen sizes not with js(like react-slick), within your css codes
